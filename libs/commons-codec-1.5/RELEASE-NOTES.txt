The Commons Codec team is pleased to announce the commons-codec-1.5 release!

The codec package contains simple encoder and decoders for
     various formats such as Base64 and Hexadecimal.  In addition to these
     widely used encoders and decoders, the codec package also maintains a
     collection of phonetic encoding utilities.

Changes in this version include:

New features:
o Add test(s) to check that encodeBase64() does not chunk output.  Issue: CODEC-93. Thanks to sebb. 
o ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when doing multiple reads() on encoding Base64InputStream.  Issue: CODEC-105. Thanks to zak. 
o Add the Cologne Phonetic to codec.lang.  Issue: CODEC-106. Thanks to it2mmeyerfa. 
o org.apache.commons.codec.net.URLCodec.ESCAPE_CHAR isn't final but should be.  Issue: CODEC-111. Thanks to ggregory. 
o Base64.encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData, boolean isChunked, boolean urlSafe, int maxResultSize) throws IAE for valid maxResultSize if isChunked is false.  Issue: CODEC-112. Thanks to sebb. 
o org.apache.commons.codec.language.RefinedSoundex.US_ENGLISH_MAPPING should be package protected MALICIOUS_CODE.  Issue: CODEC-113. Thanks to ggregory. 
o org.apache.commons.codec.language.Soundex.US_ENGLISH_MAPPING should be package protected MALICIOUS_CODE.  Issue: CODEC-114. Thanks to ggregory. 
o DoubleMetaphone.maxCodeLen should probably be private.  Issue: CODEC-115. Thanks to sebb. 
o Split Caverphone class into two classes for Caverphone 1.0 and 2.0.  Issue: CODEC-118. Thanks to ggregory. 

Fixed Bugs:
o new Base64().encode() appends a CRLF, and chunks results into 76 character lines.  Issue: CODEC-89. 
o Many test cases use getBytes() which uses the default platform encoding so tests may fail on some platforms.  Issue: CODEC-92. 
o Base64 default constructor behaviour changed to enable chunking in 1.4.  Issue: CODEC-97. Thanks to mjryall. 
o Base64.encodeBase64String() shouldn't chunk.  Issue: CODEC-99. Thanks to julius. 
o Base64InputStream#read(byte[]) incorrectly returns 0 at end of any stream which is multiple of 3 bytes long.  Issue: CODEC-101. Thanks to balusc. 
o Typo in DecoderException message thrown from Hex.decodeHex.  Issue: CODEC-103. Thanks to gnuf. 
o Caverphone encodes names starting and ending with "mb" incorrectly.  Issue: CODEC-117. Thanks to ggregory. 


Removed:
o Remove deprecated package private method Base64.discardWhitespace(byte[])  Issue: CODEC-116. Thanks to ggregory. 

Have fun!
