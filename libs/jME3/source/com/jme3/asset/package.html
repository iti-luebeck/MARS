<code>com.jme3.asset</code> contains the {@link com.jme3.asset.AssetManager}, 
a utility class that is used to load assets such as textures, models, and
sound effects in a jME3 application. <br>

<p>
    
<h3>AssetLoaders</h3>
{@link com.jme3.asset.AssetLoader asset loaders} are registered to load 
assets of a particular format. For example, an <code>AssetLoader</code> that
loads TGA images should read a stream in .tga format and return an 
{@link com.jme3.texture.Image} object as its output. 
<code>AssetLoader</code>s are initialized once a file of that format
is loaded, there's only one AssetLoader per thread so 
AssetLoader's load() method does not have to be thread safe.

<h3>AssetLocators</h3>
{@link com.jme3.asset.AssetLocators asset locators} are used to resolve 
an asset name (a string) into an {@link java.io.InputStream} which is 
contained in an {@link com.jme3.asset.AssetInfo} object. 
There are <code>AssetLocators</code> for loading files from the application's 
classpath, the local hard drive, a ZIP file, an HTTP server, and more. The user
can implement their own AssetLocators and register them with the <code>AssetManager</code>
to load their resources from their own location.
